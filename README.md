# EconomicsEngine

Swift package which is designed for economists, CFOs and CEOs. Package helps analyze any type of data, presented as tensors, with the power of econometrics &amp; neural nets

> _**IN DEVELOPMENT**_

This repository contains various algorithms and data structures 
for economic modeling, analysis, and simulation. 

**Key concepts:**

* **EconomicModeling**: This domain covers a range of 
theoretical economic concepts like regression, statistics, and 
game theory applied to real-world scenarios.
* **Data Structure and Algorithm Design**:  I provide 
implementations of various fundamental algorithms, including 
combinatorial optimization techniques (combinatorics), 
statistical analysis (regression) and neural network design 
(neural networks).

**How this project can help you:**

tools to analyze and understand large datasets.  
* **Develop simulations:**  Leverage our theoretical components 
for creating simulation models to test different scenarios.

## Table of Contents

1. **Combinatorics (Combinatorics.swift)**
    * This section explains the basic principles and 
implementations of combinatorial techniques like permutations, 
combinations, and probability calculations.
2. **EconomicError.swift** 
    * This file defines a set of custom error types specifically 
relevant to economic modeling, including data errors, network 
failures and model execution errors. 
3. **Encoders-Decoders (Encoder.swift)**

    * This section defines the tensor data structure as well as 
implementations of various matrix operations.
7. **TensorRank (TensorRank.swift)** 
    * Implements methods for calculating the rank of a tensor 
using techniques such as eigenvalue decomposition and singular 
value decomposition.
8. **TheoryOfGames (TheoryOfGames.swift)** 
    *  Includes the basic principles and implementations of game 
theory including Nash equilibrium, dominance analysis and 
expected payoff calculations.
9. **Types (Types.swift)**
   * Defines custom data structures like vector, matrix, and 
tensor types to ensure type safety and efficient implementation 
across different domains.
